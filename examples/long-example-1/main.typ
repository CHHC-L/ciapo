== How to use the input/output in C++?

In C++, `cin` is used to read input from the standard input stream (usually the keyboard), and `cout` is used to write output to the standard output stream (usually the screen).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
signed main() {
    // Read a number from the user
    int number;
    std::cin >> number;
    // Write to the screen
    std::cout << "Hello, " << number << "!" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

== What are operator and function overloading?

Operator overloading in C++ allows operators, such as `+`, `-`, `<`, `=`, `[]` and `()` to have different meanings for different types of data. For example, the `+` operator can be used to add two numbers, but it can also be used to concatenate two strings. Function overloading, on the other hand, allows a single function to have different implementations depending on the type and number of arguments passed to it. This allows for greater flexibility and code reuse.

Operators are also functions.

== What is the difference between `delete` and `delete[]` in C++?

In C++, the `delete` keyword is used to deallocate memory that was previously allocated on the heap. The `delete[]` operator is used to deallocate memory for arrays. This is necessary because arrays are allocated differently than single objects, and `delete[]` ensures that the memory for the entire array is deallocated properly.

```cpp
// Allocate memory for a single object
int *p = new int;
delete p;

// Allocate memory for an array of objects
int *q = new int[10];
delete[] q;
```

#pagebreak()

== How to concatenate strings in C++?

```cpp
string s1 = "Hello";
string s2 = "World";
s1 += "?"; // s1 is now "Hello?"
string s3 = s1 + s2; // s3 is now "Hello?World"
```

Or:

```rust
string s1 = "Hello";
string s2 = "World";
s1.append(" ");
s1.append(s2); // s1 is now "Hello World"
```

Both of these methods can be used to concatenate multiple strings together, and they can also be used to concatenate
string literals and variables of type `char*` or `char[]`.

== What does a `vector` brings, compared to an array?

Sample code for `vector`, with some functions in `<algorithm>`:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
signed main() {
    vector<int> v(2, -1);
    v.push_back(1); v.push_back(4); v.push_back(8);
    v[1] = 9; v.insert(v.begin() + 1, 2); v.pop_back();
    for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) cout << v[i] << " ";
    cout << "\n ? " << *v.begin() << " " << v.back() << endl;
    sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    vector<int>::iterator it = unique(v.begin(), v.end());
    v.erase(it, v.end());
    for (auto x : v) cout << x << " ";
    // Do not use what you can't understand :X
    return 0;
}
```

== What is an Object Oriented Programming language?

#text(size: 10pt)[

#lorem(300)

An object-oriented programming (OOP) language is a type of programming language that is based on the concept of
"objects". Object-oriented languages are designed to support the following key principles of OOP:

- Encapsulation: This refers to the idea of wrapping data and the functions that operate on that data into a single unit, called an object. Encapsulation allows the data and functions within an object to be hidden from the rest of the program, which helps to reduce the complexity of the program and to prevent unintended changes to the data.
- Abstraction: This refers to the idea of hiding the details of how an object works, and only exposing the object's interface, which is the set of functions that can be called on the object. Abstraction allows objects to be used without the need to understand the details of how they work, which makes the program easier to understand and maintain.
- Inheritance: This refers to the ability of one object, called a subclass, to inherit the properties and functions of another object, called a superclass. Inheritance allows objects to be organized into a hierarchy, where objects at the lower levels of the hierarchy inherit the properties and functions of objects at higher levels. This allows for code reuse and makes it easier to extend and modify the behavior of existing objects.
- Polymorphism: This refers to the ability of objects to have different forms, depending on the context in which they are used. In OOP languages, this is typically achieved through the use of virtual functions, which allow different objects to provide their own implementation of a function that is defined in a common base class. This allows for greater flexibility and code reuse.

Overall, OOP languages support the development of modular, reusable, and extensible code, which can make programs easier to understand, maintain, and modify. Examples of OOP languages include C++, Java, Python, and C\#.

== When specifying a class, what should be defined first, the attributes or the methods?

#bf[I don't know.] #lorem(20)

#pagebreak()

== What is the difference between `public`, `private` and `protected`?

In C++, the `public`, `private`, and `protected` access specifiers are used to specify the visibility of class members. When defining a class:

#tablex(
    columns: 4,
    align: center + horizon,
    auto-vlines: false,
    header-rows: 2,

    rowspanx(2)[#bf[Visibility]], colspanx(3)[#bf[Classes]], (), (),
    (),                           [Base], [Derived], [Others],
    
    [Private], [Yes], [No], [No],
    [Protected], [Yes], [Yes], [No],
    [Public], [Yes], [Yes], [Yes],
)

For different types of inheritance:

#tablex(
    columns: 4,
    align: center + horizon,
    auto-vlines: false,
    header-rows: 2,

    rowspanx(2)[#bf[Base class]], colspanx(3)[#bf[Derived class]], (), (),
    (),                           [Public], [Protected], [Private],
    
    [Private], [-], [-], [-],
    [Protected], [Protected], [Protected], [Private],
    [Public], [Public], [Protected], [Private],
)

== What are the benefits of using inheritance and polymorphism?

See previous questions.

Main benefits: code reuse, flexibility,
and extensibility.

== What is the diamond problem?

The diamond problem is a situation that can arise in object-oriented programming when a class inherits from multiple classes that have a common ancestor. This can cause ambiguity and lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

For example, we have a base class `A`, and two derived classes `B` and `C` that both inherit from `A`. Now, we create a new class `D` that inherits from both `B` and `C`. Now if both `B` and `C` define a method called `foo()`, then when we call `foo()` on an object of type `D`, which version of `foo()` will be called? The version defined in `B` or the version defined in `C`? Je n'ai aucune idÃ©e.

To avoid the problem, C++ provides mechanisms such as virtual inheritance. But for now, it's better to avoid diamond problem when you are designing the hierarchy diagram!

== How to use a template?

To use a template in C++, you first need to define the template by specifying the template parameters. For example:

```rust
template <typename T>
void myFunction(T arg)
{...}
```

Then to use the above function with the data type `int`, write:

```rust
myFunction<int>(10);
```

Alternatively, you can use the template argument deduction:

```rust
int a = 10;
myFunction(a);
```

== How to use t?

The Standard Template Li in C++ provides a number of algorithm functions that can be used to perform commonions on containers, such as searc

== Analyze

OK actually no need for polymorphism or inheritance. Ticket, bus and passengers don't have such "is-a" relationship. So we just define them as three different classes.

But in your exam, you may be asked to use inheritance and polymorphism according to the problem. So you still need to think about the relationship. Wrong design will lead to much lower grade!
